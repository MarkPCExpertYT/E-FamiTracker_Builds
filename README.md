# E-FamiTracker Builds
Windows builds of Eulous's E-FamiTracker



The original repo is dead but GitHub user Milkve still has it but in source form only: https://github.com/Milkve/E-FamiTracker.
I downloaded that source and built it. (Built with Windows SDK 10.0, so sadly Windows XP will not work.)

### Backstory on E-FamiTracker
E-FamiTracker (Extended FamiTracker) was a project from Eulous to make the ultimate FamiTracker with: (Chips with * are not implemented)
- 6581 SID (C64) chip
- Philips SAA1099 (SAM Coup√®) chip (no instrument editor)
- *AY-3-8910 (ZX Spectrum 128k) chip (See the Sunsoft 5B)
- AY8930 (Covox Sound Master) chip
- *SN76489 (Sega Master System) chip (see SnevenTracker)
- *T6W28 (NeoGeo Pocket Color, extended SN7) chip
- *TIA (Atari 2600, 7800) chip
- *POKEY (Atari 5200) chip
- 5E01 (Fantasy chip, works via expansion port, adds 2 noise and 2 DPCM channels) chip
- a LOT of extra features (check https://github.com/Milkve/E-FamiTracker for them all)

(all of the unimplemented chips are also in furnace so if you want to make music for them, use furnace.)

But eventually he stopped the project. He also took the GitHub link offline but GitHub user Milkve archived it (source only).
I have built that source code and I'm uploading it here.
